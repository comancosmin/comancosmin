# Hi, I'm Cosmin 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I’m a Web Developer based in Brașov, Romania, currently working within an internal HoReCa company environment, where I develop and maintain both public-facing websites and custom internal web applications.

My work goes beyond standard frontend development. The websites and applications I’ve built were designed with real business objectives in mind and optimized for SEO, resulting in significant increases in traffic, visibility, and sales for the companies I worked with. These digital solutions supported marketing strategies and sales funnels, generating measurable growth compared to the period before my involvement.

In addition to the projects showcased here on GitHub, I have developed multiple private internal applications that cannot be published publicly. These include custom dashboards, internal tools, and API integrations used across different platforms, including integrations for TV displays and other custom digital systems tailored to specific operational needs.

I work closely with marketing and operational teams, translating ideas into scalable, maintainable, and performance-focused web solutions that have a direct impact on business results.
